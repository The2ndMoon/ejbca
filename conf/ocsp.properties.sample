# ------------ OCSP responder configuration ---------------------
# These configurations are used both for EJBCA and the Validation Authority (VA).

# OCSP servlet enabled. If false there will be no servlet.
# Default is true.
#ocsp.enabled=false

# Context root (the path in the URL)
# Default is '/${app.name}/publicweb/status'
#ocsp.contextroot=/status

# Specifies the subject of a certificate which is used to identify the 
# responder which will generate responses when no real CA can be found from the request. 
# This is used to generate 'unknown' responses when a request is received for a certificate 
# that is not signed by any CA on this server. Recommended to use same as ca.dn.
#
# For the internal OCSP responder this is the subject DN of the CA to use for signing
# For an external OCSP responder this is the issuer DN of the OCSP responders certificate to use for signing, i.e. the CAs subject DN.
# Default: CN=ManagementCA,O=EJBCA Sample,C=SE
ocsp.defaultresponder=CN=ManagementCA,O=EJBCA Sample,C=SE

# If set to false the OCSP responses will only contain the signature certificate, and not the whole certificate chain of the OCSP responder. 
# Default true.
#ocsp.includecertchain=true

# Defines the ResponderID type as defined in RFC2560. Set to name for the Name type and keyhash for the KeyHash type.
# Possible values: name, keyhash
# Default: keyhash 
#ocsp.responderidtype=keyhash

# Specifies which signature algorithms should be used on OCSP responses. You can specify several algorithm
# separated by ';'. If RSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with RSA will be used, and
# if ECDSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with ECDSA will be used and if 
# DSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with DSA will be used.
#
# Default: SHA1WithRSA;SHA1WithECDSA;SHA1WithDSA
#ocsp.signaturealgorithm=SHA1WithRSA;SHA1WithECDSA;SHA1WithDSA

# The interval on which the the OCSP signing certificates are updated in seconds.
# If set to 0 or negative these certificate are never updated.
# Default: 300
#ocsp.signingCertsValidTime=0

# When a signing certificate is about to expire a WARN message could be written to log4j each time the key of the certificate is used.
# This property defines when this message is started to be written.
# The property is set to the number of seconds before the expiration that the WARN message starts to be written.
# If set to 0 the warning is disabled.
# Default: 604800 (1 week)
#ocsp.warningBeforeExpirationTime=10000

# Specifies if the OCSP-responder should require signed requests or not.
# If signature is required, the signature certificate must be issued by a CA handled by the OCSP responder.
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.signaturerequired=false

# Specifies if the OCSP-responder should require signatures to be issued by a list of allowed CA's.
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.restrictsignatures=false

# Specifies how to restrict OCSP-request signatures.
# 'issuer' means that the OCSP-responder will require signatures to be issued by a CA in a list of allowed CA's.
# 'signer' means that the OCSP-responder will require signatures to be in a list of allowed signatures.
# Note that unless ocsp.restrictsignatures is set to true this variable will not be used.
#
# Default: issuer
#ocsp.restrictsignaturesbymethod=issuer

# Specifies a directory with CA's which are allowed
# If signatures are restricted and required only requests signed by a certificate issued by a CA in this directory is accepted.
# The easiest here is to configure the full path of the directory, otherwise it will be relative to some directory where you start you app server. 
#
#ocsp.signtrustdir=signtrustdir

# Specifies an interval in seconds in which the server reloads certificates from the 'ocsp.signtrustdir'
# if this variable is set to 0 certificates will not be reloaded after startup.
#
# Default: 180
#ocsp.signtrustvalidtime=180


# If true a certificate that does not exist in the database, but is issued by a CA the responder handles
# will be treated as not revoked. Default (when value is true) is to treat is as "unknown".
# This is useful if you want an External OCSP responder database to only contain revoked certificates, and not
# all certificates.
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false

# The value of 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false' may be overridden if the URL that the client used to send the request is matching some regular expression.
# The regular expressions that if any of them is fulfilled will override 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false' is numbered from 1 and up. It may be any numbers.
# Here follows an example of 2:
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood.uri.1=.*/thisEndingIsGood$
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood.uri.2=^http://good.myhost.nu:8080/.*

# The value of 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=true' may be overridden if the URL that the client used to send the request is matching some regular expression.
# The regular expressions that if any of them is fulfilled will override 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=true' is numbered from 1 and up. It may be any numbers.
# Here follows an example of 2:
#ocsp.nonexistingisbad.uri.1=.*/thisEndingIsBad$
#ocsp.nonexistingisbad.uri.2=^http://bad.myhost.nu:8080/.*

# For HTTP get requests according to RFC5019 we can set HTTP headers in the response to allow caching proxies to cache responses.
# untilNextUpdate is the number of seconds a response will be valid. 0 = disable.
# Default: 0
#ocsp.untilNextUpdate = 0

# You can also specify different nextUpdate values depending on which certificate profiles the certificate was issued by.
# This only works when you have published using EJBCA 3.9.0 or later, where the certificateProfileId column in the CertificateData table is populated.
# You can find the certificateProfileId (999 in the example below) in the admin GUI.
# If no specific certificateProfileId is specified the default value from ocsp.untilNextUpdate is used.
#ocsp.999.untilNextUpdate = 50

# For HTTP get requests according to RFC5019 we can set HTTP headers in the response to allow caching proxies to cache responses.
# maxAge is how long a response will be cached, in seconds. Should be less than untilNextUpdate.
# Ignored if untilNextUpdate is disabled. 0 = disable.
# Default: 30
#ocsp.maxAge = 30

# You can also specify different maxAge values depending on which certificate profiles the certificate was issued by.
# This only works when you have published using EJBCA 3.9.0 or later, where the certificateProfileId column in the CertificateData table is populated.
# You can find the certificateProfileId (999 in the example below) in the admin GUI.
# If no specific certificateProfileId is specified the default value from ocsp.maxAge is used.
#ocsp.999.maxAge = 100

# Specifies OCSP extension oids that will result in a call to an extension class, 
# separate multiple entries with ';'
# For any entry that should be always used, preface with '*' (e.g. *2.16.578.1.16.3.2)
# Leave out if you do not know what this is.
# Example value: 2.16.578.1.16.3.2 (Unid)

# separate multiple entries with ;"
# Leave out if you do not know what this is.
# Example value: org.ejbca.core.protocol.ocsp.OCSPUnidExtension

# Leave out if you do not know what this is.
# No default value, must be set if the extension is used
#ocsp.uniddatsource=

#------------------- Soft keys used by external OCSP responder------------------------------

# Directory containing soft keys or certificates for keys on cards. The soft keys are in jks or p12 format.

# to be valid less than 24h 
#ocsp.rekeying.update.time.in.seconds=

# Specifies how much safety margin a certificate should have before it's updated, i.e when it should be considered a candidate for renewal. The effective
