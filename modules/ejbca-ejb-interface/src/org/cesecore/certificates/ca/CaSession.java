/*! \mainpage The CESeCore project
*
* \section section1 Heading towards Common Criteria certification
*
* In order to make the CESeCore security core publicly available for
* integration in numerous security based applications, the CESeCore
* project aims to realize a CESeCore Common Criteria EAL4+
* certification.
*
* \section section2 Reusable Java library
*
* Taking on the form of a common security function Java library, the
* CESeCore security core will provide a reusable base for implementing
* third-party trustworthy systems. The ready-made CESeCore library
* simplifies development of secure software, and allows for Common
* Criteria certification to be easily extended to any related product
* or service.
*
* \section section3 Integrator friendly
*
* CESeCore integrators will be able to correct, improve and extend their
* applications at any time - without the need to perform frequent system
* re-evaluations, nor perform continous checks of the security functions
* implemented by the security core (including features like digital
signature
* creation/validation, digital certificate and CRLs creation, key management
* and maintenance of a secure audit log).
