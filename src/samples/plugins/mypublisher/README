Minimal EJBCA plugin for EJBCA 5
================================

This sample contains a minimal EJBCA custom publisher.
It can be configured in the Admin GUI using the path:

       com.example.mypublisher.MyPublisher

For details on how to get the plugin embedded in EJBCA look into the file
EJBCAINSTALLDIR/conf/plugins/plugin.properties.sample

Only the property "plugin.ejbca.ant.file" needs to be configured to run this
sample.
