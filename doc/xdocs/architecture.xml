    <p>
    	The following diagram shows a good example setup of a secured CA with external OCSP responders
    	and an external RA server that receives certificate requests. The request are periodically 
    	pulled by the CA and responses returned to the <a href="externalra.html">External RA</a>. 
    	No network traffic flows from the right the left across FW2.

  <section name="Internal architecture">
    <p>
    	The following diagram is a very rough schema of the current architecture of EJBCA.

    <p>
    	A more developer centric deployment diagram is given below. It displays the internal three layer architecture of EJBCA. The application is packages in an ear file. 
    	In this ear file various web applications (war files) handles the interfaces with the surrounding world, mostly through various web interfaces. 
    	The web applications uses ejb session beans to perform the business operations. The session beans in turn uses a persistence layer (data entities) to persist data in the database.    
    </p>
    <p> 
        You can add your own components by for example deploying another web application (external.war) in the application server, making use of the session bean API of EJBCA.
