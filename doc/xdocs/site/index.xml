<section name="EJBCA Enterprise PKI">
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI Certificate Authority built on JEE technology. 
It is a robust, high performance, platform independent, flexible, and component based CA to be used 
stand-alone or integrated in other JEE applications.
</p>
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI, meaning that you can use EJBCA to build a complete PKI infrastructure for your organization.
If you only want to issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably options that will get you started quicker, 
but if you want a serious PKI we recommend EJBCA. EJBCA is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="docs/installation.html">Certificate Authority</a> (link to documentation site).</li>
<li>A <a href="docs/services-va.html">Validation Authority</a> (link to documentation site).</li>
<li>An <a href="docs/architecture-ocsp.html">OCSP Responder</a> (link to documentation site).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EJBCA has everything for your trust center. Contact us for more info.</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can use EJBCA to issue certificates for different purposes such as:
<ul>
<li>Strong authentication for users accessing your intranet/extranet/internet resources.</li>
<li>Secure communication with SSL servers and SSL clients.</li>
<li><a href="howto.html#Microsoft smart card logon">Smart card logon</a> to Windows and/or Linux.</li>
<li>Signing and encrypting email.</li>
<li>VPN connections by issuing certificates to your VPN routers such as OpenVPN, Cisco, Juniper etc.</li>
<li>Client VPN access with certificates in users VPN clients.</li>
<li>Single sign-on by using a single certificate to secure logon to web applications.</li>
<li>Creating signed documents.</li>
<li>Mobile PKI, <a href="docs/adminguide.html#iPhone/iOS">enrolling iOS</a> etc.</li>
<li>Secure mobile networks, i.e. <a href="http://www.3gpp.org/">3GPP</a>/LTE/4G using the <a href="docs/adminguide.html#CMP">CMP protocol</a>.</li>
<li>Counterfeit prevention by signing and pairing accessories.</li>
<li>Issue citizen certificates for access to government resources, used in passports etc.</li>
<li>Create CVCAs and DVs and issue CV certificates (CVC) to Document Verifiers and Inspection Systems for <a href="cvccas.html">EU EAC ePassports</a>.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
</p>
<note>
You can also use EJBCA to set up a CA independent, high performance, highly available OCSP responder service.
</note>
<p>Together with sister projects (see <i><a href="complementary.html">Complementary software</a></i>) of EJBCA you can also:
<ul>
<li>Get central trusted <a href="http://signserver.org">Time Stamps</a> for you electronically signed documents.</li>
<li>Perform <a href="http://signserver.org">central signing of documents</a>.</li>
<li>Sign electronic passport data (MRTD).</li>
<li>Issue hard tokens (<a href="complementary.html#Hardware%20tokens">smart cards</a>) and manage the complete life cycle of cards and certificates.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
</p>
  <note>
  The cert-cvc library handles CVC certificates for EU EAC ePassport PKIs and the current release is 
  feature complete for EU EAC ePassports using all algorithms.
  <br/>
  The library is freely usable under the LGPL 2.1 (or later) license for all parties interesting 
  in handling CVC certificates, in particular for EU EAC ePassports. 
  The cert-cvc library was donated to the open source by the Swedish National Police Board.
