    <p>
    EJBCA is an open source project and appreciates community contributions:
    <ul>
    <li>Contribute code - we love patches! If you have a new feature or bug-fix, this is the absolute fastest way get it implemented.<br/>
        A well written feature or bug-fix with proper JUnit tests have a very high probability of living on,
        thus removing the maintenance burden of patching EJBCA every time you upgrade.</li>
    <li>Contribute documentation. Documentation can always be improved.</li>
    <li>Contribute translations. Translations can always be improved.</li>
    <li>Report bugs, suggest new features and improvements. You can do it all through the <a href="http://jira.primekey.se/">Bug Database</a>.</li>
    <li>Join the EJBCA Team!</li>
    <li>Due to Common Criteria certification we can not be very generous with SVN commit access. We may get SVN access if you prove yourself, have long-term intentions and sign of on our Development Policy.</li>
    </ul>
